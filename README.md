Timeline (module for Omeka S)
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Timeline.svg?branch=develop,master)](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Timeline)

[Timeline] is a module for [Omeka S] that integrates the [SIMILE Timeline]
widget and the online [Knightlab timeline] to create timelines.

This [Omeka S] module is a full rewrite of the [fork of NeatlineTime plugin] for
[Omeka Classic]. The original NeatlineTime plugin was created by the [Scholars’ Lab]
at the University of Virginia Library and improved by various authors.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files in the module directory and rename module folder `Timeline`.

Then install it like any other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.

Note: If Omeka is https, if external assets are used, and if the Simile library
is used, the library will not load on recent browsers, because the online
library contains an url with unsecure http. In that case, you need to set the
option "Use Internal library for Simile".

Choose which fields you want the module to use on the timeline by default.

* Item Title: The field you would like displayed for the item’s title in its
  information bubble. The default is `dcterms:title`.
* Item Description: The field you would like displayed for the item’s
  description in its information bubble. The default is `dcterms:description`.
* Item Date: The field you would like to use for item dates on the timeline.
  The default is `dcterms:date`.
* Item Date End: The field you would like to use for item end dates on the
  timeline. It is useless if dates are ranges (see below) or if you don’t have
  end date.
* Render Year: Date entered as a single number, like `1066`, can be skipped,
  plotted as a single event or marked as a full year.
* Center Date: The date that is displayed by the viewer when loaded. It can
  be any date with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. An empty string means now, a
  `0000-00-00` the earliest date and `9999-99-99` the latest date.
* Viewer: The raw json parameters for the viewer, for example to display only
  one row, or to change the scale.

All these parameters can be customized for each timeline.


Usage
-----

Once enabled, the module adds two new block for site pages. The first allows to
create an automatic timeline, the other one an exhibit with selected items.
Simply select one of them and config it (the item pool and eventually the
options).

### Add a Timeline Block or an Timeline Exhibit

Creating a timeline is a two-step process:

1. From the admin panel, edit a page, then click the "Timeline" button in the
  list of new blocks to add.

2. To choose which items appear on your timeline, fill the "Item Pool" form. The
  options are the same than in the config by default (see above).

  ![Timeline Block](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Timeline/blob/master/data/readme/timeline-block-v3-4.png)

Ready! Open the page.

  ![Timeline Page](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Timeline/blob/master/data/readme/timeline-page-v3-4.png)

**Important**: The number of items should be limited according to the memory of
the server: currently, the json output is created in one shot, so it can't
manage more than some dozens or hundreds of items.

### Dates for Items

Timeline will attempt to convert the value for a date string into an [ISO 8601]
date format. Some example date values you can use:

  * `January 1, 2012`
  * `2012-01-01`
  * `1 Jan 2012`
  * `2012-12-15`

To denote spans of time, separate the start and end date with a `/`:

  * `January 1, 2012/February 1, 2012`

A common format is managed too:

  * `1939-1945`

It must be `1939/1945` to be compatible with the standard ISO 8601.

Timeline handles dates with years shorter than 4 digits. For these you may need
to pad the years with enough zeros to make them have four digits. For example,
`476` should be written `0476`.

Also, you can enter in years before common era by putting a negative sign before
the year. If the date has less than four digits, you’ll also need to add extra
zeros.

So here are some more examples of dates.

  * `0200-01-01`
  * `0002-01-01`
  * `-0002-01-01`
  * `-2013-01-01`

When a date is a single number, like `1066`, a parameter in the config page
allows to choose its rendering:

  * skip the record (default)
  * 1st January
  * 1st July
  * full year (range period)

This parameter applies with a range of dates too, for example `1939/1945`.

In all cases, it’s recommended to follow the standard [ISO 8601] as much as
possible and to be as specific as possible.

### Parameters of the viewer

Some parameters of the viewer may be customized for each timeline.

#### Simile timeline

Currently, only the `CenterDate` and the `bandInfos` are managed for the Simile
timeline. The default is automatically included when the field is empty.

```javascript
{
    "bandInfos": [
        {
            "width": "80%",
            "intervalUnit": Timeline.DateTime.MONTH,
            "intervalPixels": 100,
            "zoomIndex": 10,
            "zoomSteps": new Array(
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 280, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.HOUR},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 140, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.HOUR},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 70, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.HOUR},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 35, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.HOUR},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 400, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.DAY},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 200, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.DAY},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 100, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.DAY},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 50, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.DAY},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 400, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.MONTH},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 200, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.MONTH},
                {"pixelsPerInterval": 100, "unit": Timeline.DateTime.MONTH} // DEFAULT zoomIndex
            )
        },
        {
            "overview": true,
            "width": "20%",
            "intervalUnit": Timeline.DateTime.YEAR,
            "intervalPixels": 200
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Knightlab timeline

You can find all the available parameters in the [Knightlab timeline documentation].

Notes:
- When a field is not filled, the properties of the resource are used (title,
  description, creator).
- Date should be ISO-8601, partial ("YYYY", etc.) or full ("YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z").
  Let blank to use the date of the attachment.
- The main display date override start and end dates in some places.
- The resource can be an item id, a media id, or any other resource id.
- If the resource is not set, it’s possible to use an external content,
  generally an url, but the viewer supports some other content.
- Events are automatically sorted.

### Modifying the block template for Timeline

To modify the block template, copy it in your theme (file `view/common/block-layout/timeline.phtml`).

### Modifying the viewer

The template file used to load the timeline is `asset/js/timeline.js`.

You can copy it in your `themes/my_theme/asset/js` folder to customize it. The
same for the default css. See the main [wiki], an [example of use] with Neatline
for Omeka Classic, and the [examples] of customization on the wiki.


TODO
----

- Integrate attachments for the exhibit and improve the form (hide all by default except resource),


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
